Contribution: 

- They review the roles of topoisomerases and their connection to diseases (neurodegenerative diseases, immune disorders, and cancers).

Notes: 

- Topoisomerases function wherever there are topological problems in the DNA.
- Topoisomerases can both ensure and endanger genome integrity. For example, anticancer drugs that target TOP2 enzymes in cancer cells may trap TOP2cc (presumably in healthy cells?) at different genomic loci, which then induce genome translocations that lead to secondary malignancies.
- Anticancer drugs often trap TOP and induce DNA damage for therapeutic purposes. The selectivity of topoisomerase poisons (which increase the rate of DNA cleavage or decrease the rate of DNA religation by the topoisomerase) for cancer cells is incompletely understood, but the hypothesis is that cancer cells overexpress TOP1 and TOP2alpha and rely more on them to survive.

Questions:

* This paper goes into great detail about topoisomerases, something I've never heard of before, so I only skimmed it. I figure I can return to it if topoisomerases become more relevant to my research later on.
