Contribution: 

* They estimated the percent of R (replicative), E (environmental), and hereditary (H) mutations for different cancer types.
* They found a correlation between cancer incidence and stem cell divisions in 69 countries around the world.

Methodology: 

* Most of the methodology is in the supplementary materials -- primarily some math and statistical equations. 

Thoughts:

* The paper does a good job of elucidating the relationship and difference between % mutations attributable to $x$ versus % cancer cases attributable to $xâ€‹$. The key is that 3 driver gene mutations are necessary for a cancer case, so as long as one of them is attributable to an environmental factor, then it is preventable.
* I think the main problem with the data is that we don't know all the environmental and hereditary risk factors, which they acknowledge. So even with the most conservative analyses of environmental and hereditary risk factors, they are estimating an upper bound for R mutations. However, this is probably the best we can do.
* I wonder what the confidence intervals for their estimates are.
