# paper_notes
Inspired by [Daniel Seita](https://github.com/DanielTakeshi/Paper_Notes). 

In an effort to be more systematic and diligent about reading papers, I'm organizing notes for research papers that I've read in this repo. For each paper, I comment (at minimum) on their contribution and their methodology.

* [Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures](https://github.com/albertkuo/paper_notes/blob/master/notes/Breiman%20Statistical%20Science%202001.md) / Breiman / 2001
* [Variation in cancer risk among tissues can be explained by the number of stem cell divisions](https://github.com/albertkuo/paper_notes/blob/master/notes/Tomasetti%20Science%202015.md) / Tomasetti / 2015
* [Stem cell divisions, somatic mutations, cancer etiology, and cancer prevention](https://github.com/albertkuo/paper_notes/blob/master/notes/Tomasetti%20Science%202017.md) / Tomasetti / 2017
