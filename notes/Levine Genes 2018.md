Contribution: 

- They review the sources of mitotic errors in human tumors and how they can be used in therapy.

Notes: 

- Aneuploidy occurs in almost 70% of solid human tumors. Errors in mitosis contribute to aneuploidy.
- Chromosomal instability (CIN) refers to the high rate of chromosome gain/loss and is found in many aneupoid cancer cells. CIN contributes to intratumoral heterogeneity.
- SAC is a surveillance mechanism that delays separation of sister chromatids until all kinetochores have made correct attachments to spindle MTs. Mutations can weaken SAC or render it unnecessary. But mutations in SAC genes are rare in human tumors, so it's likely not a major contributor.
- Merotelically attached chromosomes/lagging anaphase chromosomes are observed in cells with CIN. These are due to hyperstabilized K-MT interactions, centrosome amplification, and altered timing of centrosome separation.
- Chromosomes lagging in middle of the spindle can become damaged in cleavage furrow. They may also be partitioned into micronuclei.
- Mitotic errors usually trigger activation of p53 (tumor suppressor protein).
- Aneuploid cells are likely selected against, explaining why they are rare in healthy tissue.
- Next-generation mitosis-specific drugs will hopefully target tumor-specific vulnerabilities. 

Questions/comments:

* Are there any hypotheses about why SAC gene mutations are rare in human tumors? 
* This was a pretty long paper that I didn't finish, but it's relatively straightforward to read so I should feel encouraged if I want to come back to it.
