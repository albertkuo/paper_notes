Contribution: 

- They discuss examples of cytokine engineering for immunotherapies.

Notes: 

- In their cytokine engineering workflow, they use a cytokine-recepter complex structure to guide engineering with a yeast surface display.
- Example: engineer Type 1 IFN, a family of cytokines
- Example: engineer IL-2, a cytokine that plays a role in the adaptive immune system
  - IL-2 controls a balance of immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive responses
  - Want to modulate the affinity of IL-2 to different receptors, engineer an IL-2 mutant with desired properties
- Example: engineer Il-15, a cytokine variant of IL-2
- Example: engineer IL-4, a cytokine that modulates innate and adaptive immunity, and also immunostimulatory/immunosuppressive responses via type I vs type II receptors
  - They engineer an IL-4 mutant (super-4) that has high selectivity for type I receptor
- Example: engineer IL-13

Thoughts:

- I only skimmed this paper, but at a high-level, I could understand the challenges in protein engineering for immunotherapy. For example, many of these cytokines have multiple effects (e.g. immunosuppressive and immunostimulatory roles), so targeting one desired effect requires understanding the processes at a molecular level.
