Contribution: 

- They review pathways for DNA damage signaling and repair and discuss how DNA damage response both leads to cancers and can be used in cancer treatment. 

Notes: 

- BRCA genes reesult in defective repair of DSBs (double-strand breaks) by homologous recombination (HR).
- DNA damage response (DDR) follows a pathway: initial detection -> DNA repair -> induction of cell death.
- PI3K-like kinases ATM responds to DSBs and ATR responds to ssDNA (single-stranded DNA) regions.
- Ionizing radiation (IR) and topoisomerase inhibitors induce DSBs and are widely used in cancer treatment.
- " Synthetic lethality describes a condition where a disruption of two redundant DDR pathways results in accumulation of DNA damage leading to cell death, whereas abrogation of only one pathway is tolerated by the cell."
- Hereditary forms of BRCA1/2 mutations have been targeted with PARP inhibitor under the concept of synthetic lethality. But non-hereditary forms of BRCA1/2-deficient tumors appear to develop resistance to PARP inhibitors by restoring BRCA1/2 functions.
