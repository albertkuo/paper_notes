Inspired by [Daniel Seita](https://github.com/DanielTakeshi/Paper_Notes). 

In an effort to be more systematic about the papers I read, I've created this repo. I organize the papers chronologically by when I first read them. Each paper is then rated under a (1) - (3) system, where (1) means I only skimmed the paper and (3) means I read all (or close to all) of it.
