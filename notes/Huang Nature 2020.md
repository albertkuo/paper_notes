Contribution: 

- They describe how new cancer drug targets can be discovered with CRISPR-based functional genomic screening and "synthetical lethality." 

Notes: 

- "Mutational analysis of tumours has largely been exhausted as a strategy for the identification of new cancer targets that are druggable with conventional approaches."
- An example of "synthetic lethality" is the case of a tumor suppressor gene -- when both genes are inactivated, that contributes to cancer development, but not when only one gene in the pair is inactivated.
- They discuss the success of PARP (polyADP-ribose polymerase) inhibitors in BRCA-mutant ovarian cancers. PARP inhibition causes tumor cell-specific death in BRCA gene-mutated tumor cells. Both PARP and BRCA1 are components of DNA repair, and some sort of interaction between them makes BRCA1/2 mutations sensitive to PARP inhibition.
- However, the discovery of PARP was fortuitous and hypothesis-driven, and they argue that a "functional genomic approach" is better (i.e. using CRISPR?), given the potentially large number of synthetic lethal interactions.
- Another example they describe is with MTAP deletion. MTAP is a passneger gene that is frequently co-deleted with CDKN2A, a kinase inhibitor. MTAP-null is related to PRMT5, a methyltransferase, so PRMT5 inhibition can be targeted in MTAP-deleted tumors.

Questions/thoughts:

* This article was very difficult for me to read. I understood at a very broad level that finding druggable targets is a big issue and that CRISPR will be helpful in that regard. But I think that because it was a review, there was a lot of information, all of which was explained tersely, so it was difficult for me to digest.
