Contribution: 

- They summarize our understanding of ErbB receptors and talk about their use as targets in cancer therapy.

Notes: 

- There are four members of EGF receptors (aka ErbB or HER receptors): EGFR/HER1, HER2, HER3, and HER4. The receptors can form homodimer (2 of the same) or heterodimer (2 of different receptors) formations.
- Activated EGFRs leads to multiple downstream pathways related to cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, and gene transcription.
- ErbB receptors can move directly to the nucleus to influence gene transcription and upregulates many genes believed to be important in cancer biology.
- Negative regulation of signaling can occur immediately through dephosphorylation and internalization of activated receptors, or in a delayed matter with negative regulators and lysosomal degradation of receptors.
- Aberrant signaling of EGF has been linked to Alzheimer's and schizophrenia, and cancer. For cancers, overexpression of ErbB receptors is common.
- There are several humanzied monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) already in clinical use that target ErbB receptors. However, there is a high rate of resistance to TKI therapy.

Thoughts:

- This paper was interesting to read, but I think I'm lacking some context on how important/special EGFRs are in our understanding of cancer. Are they just one of a few things that has been well-studied, or are there many things like EGFRs that are also targets for cancer therapy? A: It's one of the ones that are better understood, especially with its connection to cancer.
