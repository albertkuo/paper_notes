Contribution: 

- They argue that there are 6 acquired capabilities of cancer. This was supposed to be pivotal because they conceptualized common traits for all cancers (rather than thinking about it by tissue).

Notes: 

- The six essential characteristics of cancer cells are: 1) self-sufficiency in growth signals, 2) insensitivity to anti-growth signals, 3) evading apoptosis, 4) limitless replicative potential, 5) sustained angiogenesis, and 6) tissue invasion and metastasis. 
- In addition to the 6 characteristics, they theorize that genomes of tumor cells must be less stable in order for the other 6 capabilities to be acquired through mutations. There must be a malfunction in the "caretaker" systems in charge of maintaining the genome (e.g. p53). 
- Most human cancer deaths (90%) are caused by metastases.
- Loss of p53 function occurs in "most human tumors."

Thoughts:

- I think it's a bit strange that papers often talk about cancer cells as if they have a purposeful agency, e.g. cancer cells "learn" to do X. It's strange because as this paper itself mentions, cancer cells likely acquire their characteristics through Darwinian evolution and not because they "intend" to learn anything.
- There were a lot of biological details that just went over my head -- the names of different antibodies, proteins, factors didn't mean much to me, but I assume many of them would be familiar to someone coming from a biology background.
- Since this paper was written 20 years ago, it was pretty interesting to read what they thought would happen in the future. I think a lot of the goals are essentially the same, e.g. precision medicine and detection.
