Contribution: 

- They compare different experimental methods for single-cell or single-nucleus profiling in terms of what biological information can be retrieved.

Notes: 

- They tried 2 low-throughput ("plate-based") and 5 high-throughput ("bead-based") methods. All 7 were used for single-cell RNA, while only 4 were used for single-nucleus RNA.
- They analyzed three sample types -- mixture of human and mouse cell lines, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and mouse cortex nuclei.
- They used one computational pipeline, "scumi," across all the experimental methods. However, they also did try using the "standard pipeline" for each experimental method.
