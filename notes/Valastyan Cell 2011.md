Contribution: 

- They review our understanding of the metastatic cascade at a molecular level.

Notes: 

- There are multiple steps in the metastatic cascade (they discuss 7, or 9 in Figure 1). Basically, the cancer cells must enter the blood, arrest at distant organ sites, and then survive and proliferate at those sites.
- In some of these steps, there is positive reinforcement of cancer cells (e.g. factors in the stroma that increase aggressiveness of cancer cells), but in most of these steps, there are significant barriers to the cancer cells (e.g. survival in circulation).
- Most micrometastases lie dormant or suffer slow attrition.
- Genes have been identified for organ-specific metastatic tropism, and breast carcinoma cells colonizing lungs use different genetic/epigenetic programs than breast carcinoma cells colonizing bone, brain, or liver.
- Some cancer types display long latency periods prior to metastasis (e.g. breast), while others don't (e.g. lung and pancrease).
- The "parallel progression model" hypothesizes that quasi-normal cells can disseminate from preneoplastic lesions and then go through clonal selection within distant organ sites. This is in contrast to the traditional "linear progression model," where the metastatic cells must come from the primary tumor. However, while quasi-normal cells can enter into circulation, evidence of the "parallel progression model" is scant.

Thoughts:

- I appreciated that there were varying levels of certainty about the different things talked about in the paper. For things that we were unclear on, there were often interesting theories proposed, and I think it'll be exciting to find out which theory was closest to the truth.
