Contribution: 

- They formulate a hierarchical model to use both single cell and bulk RNA-seq data.

Methodology: 

- They use a hierarchical model with a Gibbs-EM algorithm to estimate parameters.
- They demonstrate their method with a simulation and application to data.

Thoughts:

- The introduction was again helpful for me to read, as it provides some intuition into why people are interested in single-cell data. In particular, it talks about an example with brain tissue and schizophrenia. It also talks about challenges with single cell data (dropouts) and bulk data (mixing of cell types).
- I didn't read the paper in full, but it touches upon a lot of topics relevant to my research projects, so I may revisit it later.
