Contribution: 

- They discuss cellular and molecular changes associated with aging and how they affect tumor development and therapy response.

Notes: 

- Senescent cells release SASP factors (growth factors, chemokines, proinflammatory cytokines) that can induce proliferation of nearby cancer cells. 
- Loss of fibroblast density with aging, due to accumulation of localized cell losses.
- The stiffness of the ECM varies by tissue, and the stiffness fits a biphasic model for cell invasion. The ECM stiffness decreases as we age.
- Inflammaging can lead to issue degeneration and disrupt acute inflammation, thus allowing for cancer progression.
- Immunosenescence is another contributing factor to cancer and other age-related pathologies.
- The aged microenvironment can contribute to chemotherapeutic resistance.
