Contribution: 

* He argues that there are four challenges for global health networks that determine how successful they are: problem definition (internal consensus about what the issue is), positioning (portrayal of the issue to others), coalition-building (alliances with people outside health sector), and governance (establishing institutions to address issue).

Thoughts:

* This isn't a statistics/biostatistics paper, but it is relevant to public health and talks about topics I've wondered about (e.g. Why are more resources allocated to addressing some diseases/issues than others?), so I wanted to read it.
* Two case studies discussed that were more interesting for me to read were tobacco (successful global network) and alcohol (unsuccessful global network), though I wish more was written about the latter.
* There is not much data and a lot of exposition (e.g. "the network has been remarkably cohesive, guided by a small, informal group of committed health professionals and the health-oriented agencies they work for"). It is hard for me to understand how they are able to support their claims -- how do they decide if a network is "cohesive" or not? Do we just have to trust their judgment?
* This article reads a lot like a textbook to me. I wonder if this is common in the field of health policy.
