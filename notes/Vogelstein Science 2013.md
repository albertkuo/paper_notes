Contribution: 

- They summarize the "current" (in 2013) understanding of cancer genomes. 

Notes: 

- Since there was no methodology, I will instead summarize their main points.
- **Background** 
  - In solid tumors, there are about 30-60 nonsynonymous (i.e. they alter proteins) mutations. 95% of these somatic mutations are single-base substitutions, while the rest are deletions or insertions. Most tumor cells display aneuploidy, deletions, inversions, translocations, and other genetic abnormalities, even though the rate of point mutations is similar to normal cells.
  - Some tumor types, like melanomas and lung, have higher numbers of nonsynonymous mutations (200 mutations per tumor). Tumors with mismatch repair defect have even higher numbers of mutations, in the thousands.
  - The number of mutations is correlated with age, which is pediatric cancers have fewer mutations.
  - Driver mutations give a small selective growth advantage to tumor cells (0.4% increase), but over time, this can result in a large mass.
  - Almost all genetic and epigentic alterations are passenger changes.
  - No metastasis genes have been found and almost all mutations in metastatic lesions were already present in primary tumors. This may simply be because metastasis is a stochastic process.
  - Some driver genes can be clearly identified by the high number of mutations in the tumor (e.g. TP53 or KRAS), i.e. "mountains." But most genes are "hills" and harder to identify by frequency alone.
  - Mut-driver genes have elevated numbers of mutations in tumors. Epi-driver genes are expressed aberrantly in tumors but not frequently mutated. Among mut-driver genes, oncogenes are defined to have >20% of their mutations at recurrent positions and missense, and tumor suppressor genes are defined to have >20% of their mutations to be inactivating. 125 mut-driver genes have been discovered: 71 are tumor suppressors and 54 are oncogenes. 
  - Solid tumors generally require 5-8 alterations in driver genes based on epidemiologic studies. In genetic data, the number of genes mutated is often 3-6, due to technical issues, a focus on coding regions, and the existence of epi-driver genes.
  - Genetic heterogeneity: intratumoral (among cells of one tumor), intermetastatic (among different metastatic lesions in the same patient), intrametastatic (among cells of an individual metastasis), and interpatient (among tumors of different patients)
  - Most cancer patients die because their tumors were not removed before metastasis to surgically inaccessible sites, such as the liver, brain, lung, or bone. Metastatic lesions generally cannot be removed by surgery and must be treated with other therapies, but these lesions usually recur due to the presence of resistance mutations, so multiple combination drugs should be given if possible.
  - Driver genes influence 3 cellular processes: cell fate (favoring division over differentiation), cell survival (proliferate under limiting nutrient concentrations), genome maintenance (defects in checkpoints for apoptosis)
- **Treatment**
  - Genome-based medicine: drugs can target mutations (e.g. kinase inhibitors) among patients that have those mutations. Knowledge of the genes encoding drug-metabolizing enzymes can also inform the dose of the drug that should be given to a patient.
  - Challenges: drugs usually interfere with protein functions and cannot replace defective tumor suppressors. However, tumor suppressor gene inactivation may result in the activation of another signal downstream of the pathway that can be targeted.
  - Pathway functions depend on the organism, cell type, and precise genetic alterations in the cell.
  - Immunotherapies: tumor-specific antigens can help the immune system eradicate the tumor.
  - Early diagnosis: tumorigenesis takes decades to develop. In theory, driver gene mutations and proteins are detectable (urine, saliva, stool), and the default plan should be on prevention and early detection.

Thoughts:

- I wish I had read this paper earlier -- it would've been good background knowledge to have.
- I wasn't always clear on when they were talking about genes vs mutations. At one point, they said that common solid tumors have "33-66 genes with mutations that alter protein products," and at another point, they say that common solid tumors have "30-70 mutations that alter proteins." This seems contradictory, unless each gene only has one mutation? Or maybe the first statement was just a typo (see Figure 1)? A: I think not all mutations in genes are consequential (i.e. alter proteins).
- Are driver gene mutations different from nonsynonymous mutations in tumor cells? In theory, a driver gene mutation is define as a mutation that confers a selective growth advantage and a nonsynonymous mutation is one that alters protein products. But in practice, are these two things distinguishable? If we know of a nonsynonymous mutation in a tumor cell, can we tell if it's a driver gene mutation or not? Or is it always assumed to be a driver mutation? A: The way they define a driver gene is through the pattern of mutations in that gene. There can be nonsynonymous mutations that are not driver mutations if those nonsynonymous mutations are not located in a driver gene. There are genes that are involved in growth that aren't part of oncogenesis.
- Are we able to distinguish between driver gene mutations versus passenger gene mutations in a driver gene? If so, how? A: This may be evident through the pattern of mutations. Presumably, passenger gene mutations should be less frequent.
