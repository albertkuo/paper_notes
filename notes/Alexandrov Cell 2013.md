I started off reading [Signatures of mutational processes in human cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3776390/), was trying to figure out their methodology, then realized I should probably be reading this paper instead. In "Signatures," they characterized 21 genome-wide mutational signatures through association with age, known mutational processes, and mutagenic characteristics (e.g. if it's on a transcribed strand, insertions/deletions, etc.).
