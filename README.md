Inspired by [Daniel Seita](https://github.com/DanielTakeshi/Paper_Notes). 

In an effort to be more systematic and diligent about reading papers, I'm organizing notes for research papers that I've read in this repo.

* [**Detection and localization of surgically resectable cancers with a multi-analyte blood test**]([https://github.com/albertkuo/paper_notes/blob/master/notes/Cohen%20Science%202018.md](https://github.com/albertkuo/paper_notes/blob/master/notes/Cohen Science 2018.md)) / Cohen / 2018
