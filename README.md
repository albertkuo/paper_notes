# paper_notes
Inspired by [Daniel Seita](https://github.com/DanielTakeshi/Paper_Notes). 

In an effort to be more systematic and diligent about reading papers, I'm organizing notes for research papers that I've read in this repo. For each paper, I comment (at minimum) on their contribution and their methodology.
